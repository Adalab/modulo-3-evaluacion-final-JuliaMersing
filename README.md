# React evaluation: Rick and Morty Directory

This project was built using React. The goal was to create a Rick & Morty's character finder through an API. It gives you a list of 20 characters and you can sort them by name, species, gender and status.

You can also click on any given character card to find more info about it.

## Initial Requirements

- Create a react app.
- The app must fetch from an API.
- Render the characters information on the home page. Required information is: Picture, name and specie.
- Add a filter that allows the user to search by name any character.
- There are four mandatory components: Filters, CharacterList, CharacterCard and CharacterDetail.
- If the user clicks on any character card, a new route must be created that shows the clicked character detail. Detail must show previous information plus origin planet and episodes.

## Bonus

- Semantic must be right.
- When the user filters if it press the enter key nothing must happen.
- If the user search an unexistant character we must give a feedback.
- The filter must work either if the user writes with caps on or not.
- When in the character detail if the user wants to go back to the home page the search input value must remain.

## Extra features

- Add some styles.
- Use grid for the character list.
- Make it responsive.
- Show icons for status and specie.
- The character URL must be shareable.
- If we refresh the browser, character information must be kept.
- If the user goes to unexistant pages we must give a proper feedback.
- Order the character list alphabetically.
- Add an extra filter to search by specie.

## Built with

- Visual Code Studio: as code editor
- SASS
- React

## Can you help me to improve?
